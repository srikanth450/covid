Modify Your PEM File
Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) enables you to work interactively with your cluster, allowing you to test cluster steps or troubleshoot your cluster environment. You use your PEM file to authenticate to the master node. The PEM file requires a modification based on the tool you use that supports your operating system.

To modify your credentials file:
Download PuTTYgen.exe to your computer from:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Launch PuTTYgen
Click Load
Select the PEM file you created earlier
Click Open
Click OK on the PuTTYgen Notice telling you the key was successfully imported
Enter a pass phrase in the Key passphrase field
Click Save private key to save the key in the PPK format
Enter a name for your PuTTY private key, such as, mykeypair.ppk
Click Save
Exit the PuTTYgen application

Your credentials file is now modified to allow you to log in directly to the master node of your running cluster.
